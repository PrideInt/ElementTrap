# ElementTrap

Hold shift at a mob, and particles will show up, diagonally orbiting the mob. You will then begin to shoot elements, reigning from Air, Fire, Water and Earth. There is a delay for each element. Afterwards, they will be encased in an Elemental Sphere. You can either control them using your cursor and they will move to that direction. Or, you can hold shift until a rainbow particle appears, left click, and they will succumb to the elements. You can additionally press left click (without sneaking) to pull them towards you.
